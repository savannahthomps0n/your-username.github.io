            <!-- write a paragraph explaining why your person is so great  -->
            <p>Marin was a very strong and willing man. He stood up for society to try and end segregation. All he wanted was for black and white people to be equal. Not to mention, what he was doing was very dangerous. This made people become very angry. However, this didn't bother him. Tillhe day he died, he stood up for him and his kind to try and make a change.
